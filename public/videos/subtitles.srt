0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Instructor…All right, let's start off

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
here. We were, I think, wrapping up kind

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of our overview, and here's just a

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
little, simple map of where the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
locations of some of the key Pauline

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
epistles to the churches are found. Of

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
course, Rome, Italy, Corinth in the

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
south of Greece, Thessalonica further to

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the north in Greece, Philippi even

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
further – and further to the north in

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Greece, Ephesus, which is on the Western

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Turkish Coast, what is Western Turkey

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
today, Colossae a little further inland.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All Colossae is today is a hill – is a

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
mound, basically.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you go to Colossae today, none of it

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
has really been dug up at all. It's one

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
of the few remaining untouched biblical

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
archaeological sites. My understanding

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is, is that they're working, I think, to

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
get ready to do a dig there, but so far

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that has been completely left alone. If

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
you go to Laodicea or Hierapolis, which

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
are cities that are in a triangle in

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that region, those two cities are quite

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
developed in terms of archaeological

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
sites, with a lot of rich history,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
particularly in the couple of

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
generations after the time of the New

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Testament. But Colossae has yet to be

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
developed as an archaeological site.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And in Galatia, you'll see there's no

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
marking of a particular city there, and

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that obscures two things. One is a

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
debate about – the major thing is the

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
debate about which – where we're talking

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
about in Galatia. Galatia is a region

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
more than a particular city. And so,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
there are two theories: There's a

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Northern Galatian Theory and a Southern

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Galatian Theory.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know how to make an analogy for

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it other than to say it's the difference

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
between writing between – to Dallas/Fort

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Worth versus writing to Houston, okay,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
northern versus southern Texas. But

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
anyway, so some of the debate is related

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to whether we're dealing with the north

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
or the south of Galatia. And there's no

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
city attached to it, as is obvious –

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
there's no dot there – because that not

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
only could depend on what theory you

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
develop, but then once you do that,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you're covering a region and not a

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
particular locale.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Most of these letters that Paul wrote to

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
these regional areas – this is an

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
important point – were not just directed

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
strictly to the community to which they

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
written, but became – that city became a

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
hub for the various communities that

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
were gathered around it. So, for

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
example, the letter to the Ephesians in

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
all likelihood circulated up and down

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the western coast, so the letter that

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
got written to Ephesus would have

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
eventually circulated its way to

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Colossae.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There's a letter to the Laodiceans that

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we don't have. At least we think there

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
was a letter to the Laodiceans that we

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
don't have. That would have circulated

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in a similar kind of manner. And so

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
these cities oftentimes operated as kind

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
of hubs or headquarters for the

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
communities in the area and created –

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and there was kind of an

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
inner-communication network, if you want

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to think of it that way, that existed

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
between these churches as they passed

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
materials backward and forwards, as

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Pauline – more people who worked with

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Paul – moved, in some cases, from site

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to site and gave oversight to some of

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
what was going on. Yeah, Dan.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Student…Would it have been as efficient

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
as the lost letters, like, a couple of

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
days and it's there?

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Instructor…It would have been – well, it

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
would have been as efficient as the

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
travel was to the time period, which is

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
basically that you would cover – if you

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
did it by foot, you might cover up to 20

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
miles a day. If you did it by horse, you

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
might cover double or triple that,

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
depending on hard you pushed.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Student…So it was widespread, right.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Instructor…Yeah, what?

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Student…It was widespread. They did have

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
lots of people doing it.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Instructor…Well, they had a few people

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
doing it. I wouldn't say it would be

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
widespread. There were a few people

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
engaged in commerce who were going back

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and forth. But most people did not

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
travel like we do today. They stayed

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
pretty much in one place and were used

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to, very much, to one locale. Yes.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Student…I'm trying to think. Did you say

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that, like, this was Paul's intentions

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
or is that kind of more [crosstalk] –

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Instructor…Well, I think – I don't know

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
whether it was Paul's intention, per se,

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
or it's just the way things worked

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
between these communities. These

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
communities would have needed their

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
mutual support because by choosing to be

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
in the church, oftentimes, you're

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
choosing to isolate yourself socially.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And so, this would have been one of the

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
ways for mutual encouragement, would be

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
for these communities to stay in some

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
contact with one another.
