								<p class="text-justify"><b>Availability; Acceptance.</b> Graphic Studio Central Ltd will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify Agency within two (2) business days of receipt of an IO signed by Agency if the specified inventory is not available. Acceptance of the IO and these Terms will be deemed the earlier of (i) written (which, unless otherwise specified, for purposes of these Terms, will include paper, fax, or e-mail communication) approval of the IO by Graphic Studio Central Ltd and Agency, or (ii) the display of the first Ad impression by Graphic Studio Central Ltd, unless otherwise agreed on the IO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, modifications to the originally submitted IO will not be binding unless approved in writing by both Graphic Studio Central Ltd and Agency.</p>
								<p class="text-justify">Revisions to accepted IOs will be made in writing and acknowledged by the other party in writing.</p>

								<h2> AD PLACEMENT AND POSITIONING</h2>
								<p class="text-justify"><b>Compliance with IO. </b> Graphic Studio Central Ltd will comply with the IO, including all Ad placement restrictions and will use commercially reasonable efforts to create a reasonably balanced delivery schedule; provided that, Advertiser and Agency acknowledge that given the nature of Graphic Studio Central Ltd's business impressions on Sites may vary at times. Graphic Studio Central Ltd will provide, within the scope of the IO, an Ad to the Site specified on the IO when such Site is visited by an Internet user. Any exceptions will be approved by Agency in writing.</p>
								<p class="text-justify"><b>Changes to Site.</b> Graphic Studio Central Ltd will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Agency at least 10 business days prior notification of any material changes to the Site that would materially change the target audience or materially affect the size or placement of the Ad specified on the applicable IO. Should such a modification occur with or without notice, as Agency's and Advertiser's sole remedy for such change, Agency may cancel the remainder of the affected placement without penalty within the 10-day notice period. If Graphic Studio Central Ltd has failed to provide such notification, Agency may cancel the remainder of the affected placement within 30 days of such modification and, in such case, will not be charged for any affected Ads delivered after such modification.</p>
								<p class="text-justify"><b>Technical Specifications.</b> Graphic Studio Central Ltd will submit or otherwise make electronically accessible to Agency final technical specifications within two (2) business days of the acceptance of an IO.

								<h2>PAYMENT AND PAYMENT LIABILITY</h2>
								<p class="text-justify"><b>Invoices.</b> The initial invoice will be sent by Graphic Studio Central Ltd upon completion of the first month's delivery, or within 30 days of completion of the IO, whichever is earlier. Invoices will be sent to Agency's billing address as set forth on the IO and will include information reasonably specified by Agency, such as the IO number, Advertiser name, brand name or campaign name, and any number or other identifiable reference stated as required for invoicing on the IO. All invoices (other than corrections of previously provided invoices) pursuant to the IO will be sent within 90 days of delivery of all Deliverables. Graphic Studio Central Ltd acknowledges that failure by Graphic Studio Central Ltd to send an initial invoice within such period may cause Agency to be contractually unable to collect payment from the Advertiser. If Graphic Studio Central Ltd sends the initial invoice after the 90-day period and the Agency either has not received the applicable funds from the Advertiser or does not have the Advertiser's consent to dispense such funds, Agency will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Graphic Studio Central Ltd in collecting payment from the Advertiser or obtaining Advertiser's consent to dispense funds. Any failure by Agency to invoice the Advertiser within this time frame shall not in any way limit Graphic Studio Central Ltd's ability to collect funds from the Advertiser.<p class="text-justify">
									<p class="text-justify">Upon request from the Agency, Graphic Studio Central Ltd should provide proof of performance for the invoiced period, which may include access to online or electronic reporting, as addressed in these Terms. </p>
									<p class="text-justify">Graphic Studio Central Ltd should invoice Agency for the services provided with the net cost (i.e., the cost after subtracting any applicable discounts and commissions, including but not limited to Agency commissions, if any) based on actual delivery, flat-fee, or based on prorated distribution of delivery over the term of the IO, as specified on the applicable IO. </p>
									<p class="text-justify">The Advertiser or Agency will be charged based on the number of impressions. We will use the COST PER THOUSAND (CPM) method to calculate the advertising cost.</p>

									<p class="text-justify"><b>Advertising cost  = Total number of impressions/ 1000 x CPM.</b></p>

									<p class="text-justify"><b>Payment Date.</b> Order acceptance is subject to credit approval of Advertiser and/or Agency; Advertiser shall provide information reasonably requested by Graphic Studio Central Ltd to evaluate such entity's credit and Graphic Studio Central Ltd reserves the right to cancel credit at any time for any reason in its sole discretion, with or without notice. Provided credit is approved, payment is due thirty (30) days from invoice date, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Graphic Studio Central Ltd. </p>

Advertiser shall keep records related to payments made by it to Agency with respect to services provided by Graphic Studio Central Ltd under this Agreement and Agency shall keep records related to payments received by it from Advertiser with respect to services provided by Graphic Studio Central Ltd under this Agreement, and upon reasonable notice from Graphic Studio Central Ltd, Advertiser and Agency shall allow Graphic Studio Central Ltd to review such records. Unless otherwise set forth by the Graphic Studio Central Ltd in the IO, a 2% per month (pro-rated for part thereof) penal interest on late payments shall be levied from the date of receipt of an invoice by the Graphic Studio Central Ltd.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">Agency agrees to make every reasonable effort to collect and clear payment from Advertiser on a timely basis.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">Agency's credit is established on a client-by-client basis.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">If Advertiser proceeds have not cleared for the IO, other advertisers from Agency will not be prohibited from advertising on the Site due to such non-clearance if such other advertisers' credit is not in question.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">Upon request, Agency will make available to Graphic Studio Central Ltd written confirmation of the relationship between Agency and Advertiser. This confirmation should include, for example, Advertiser's acknowledgement that Agency is its agent and is authorized to act on its behalf in connection with the IO and these Terms. In addition, upon the request of Graphic Studio Central Ltd, Agency will confirm whether Advertiser has paid to Agency in advance funds sufficient to make payments pursuant to the IO.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">If Advertiser's or Agency's credit is or becomes impaired, Graphic Studio Central Ltd may require payment in advance.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">Payment Recovery Costs. Pursuant to Section III(b) above, in the event that Graphic Studio Central Ltd is required to seek payment directly from Advertiser, Graphic Studio Central Ltd may impose additional costs on Advertiser in relation to the IO associated with the recovery of the outstanding payment (i.e., the reasonable costs of debt recovery companies instructed to recover the payments).</p>

									<h2>Reporting</h2>
									<p class="text-justify"><b>Graphic Studio Central Ltd Reporting.</b> If Graphic Studio Central Ltd is serving the campaign, Graphic Studio Central Ltd may make reporting available at least as often as weekly, either electronically or in writing, unless otherwise specified on the IO. Reports will be broken out by day and summarized by creative execution, content area (Ad placement), impressions, clicks, spend/cost, and other variables as may be defined on the IO (e.g., keywords).</p>
									<p class="text-justify">Once Graphic Studio Central Ltd has provided the online or electronic report, if applicable, it agrees that Agency and Advertiser are entitled to reasonably rely on it, subject to provision of Graphic Studio Central Ltd's invoice for such period.</p>
